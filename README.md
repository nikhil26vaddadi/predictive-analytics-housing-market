# Predictive Analytics: Dublin Housing Market

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores predictive modeling of Dublin housing prices as part of the MSc Business Analytics program at University College Cork. The goal was to identify key drivers of house prices and build machine learning models for accurate price prediction.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Methodology
1. Data preprocessing and exploratory analysis
2. Feature engineering (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables)
3. Model training (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree)
4. Performance evaluation using RMSE, R², and cross-validation

## 📊 Results
- Random Forest achieved the best performance with R² = 0.87 and lowest RMSE.
- Identified key factors influencing house prices such as location, number of rooms, and property size.
