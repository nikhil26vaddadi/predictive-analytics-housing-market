# Predictive Analytics: Dublin Housing Market  

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
This project explores predictive modeling of Dublin housing prices using statistical and machine learning techniques. Implemented as part of my MSc Business Analytics program at University College Cork (UCC), the analysis applies regression models to real-world housing data to uncover key drivers of price variation and deliver actionable insights for forecasting.

## âœ¨ Key Features  
- Data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory analysis.  
- Applied regression models: **Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest**.  
- Model evaluation using **RMSE, RÂ², and cross-validation**.  
- Visualizations for feature importance and prediction accuracy.  
- Comparison of baseline and advanced models to improve forecasting accuracy.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack  
- **Languages:** Python  
- **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, statsmodels  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

## ðŸ“Š Results  
- Identified top features influencing house prices (e.g., location, property size, and amenities).  
- Achieved **[insert best RÂ² / RMSE score here from your report]**, demonstrating reliable predictive performance.  
- Ridge regression generalized better than simple linear regression, reducing overfitting.
