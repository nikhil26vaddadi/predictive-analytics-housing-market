# Predictive Analytics: Dublin Housing Market  

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
This project explores predictive modeling of Dublin housing prices using statistical and machine learning techniques. Implemented as part of my MSc Business Analytics program at University College Cork (UCC), the analysis applies regression models to real-world housing data to uncover key drivers of price variation and deliver actionable insights for forecasting.

## âœ¨ Key Features  
- Data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory analysis.  
- Applied regression models: **Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest**.  
- Model evaluation using **RMSE, RÂ², and cross-validation**.  
- Visualizations for feature importance and prediction accuracy.  
- Comparison of baseline and advanced models to improve forecasting accuracy.  

---

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack  
- **Languages:** Python  
- **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, statsmodels  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook  

---

## ðŸ“Š Results  
- Ensemble methods (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Stacking) consistently outperformed baseline models.  
- Achieved **75% accuracy** with Random Forest and Stacking models after hyperparameter tuning.  
- Logistic Regression improved from 61% baseline to **74% accuracy** with regularization.  
- Models demonstrated strong precision for predicting non-purchases, but recall for purchases remained a challenge due to class imbalance.
